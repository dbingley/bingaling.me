  <p>New to this coding malarkey, as you scroll throughout this website, you will discover the steps it has taken to produce this, mediocre website.</p>
  <p>The website's main content will more than likely be images, that's if I can work out how to add them haha.</p>
  <p>I might add some random stuff that interests me in this section, maybe even some images if you're lucky. </p>
